## General info
In a group of 6, we developed an application as a scored and evaluated project for the module 'Praktikum Software Engineering' at the University of Mannheim, whereby our team number was 13 (as in the title).

## Technologies
Project is created with
* JavaFX version: 11  -- GUI & Sound
* JDOM2               -- XML-Parsing
* Maven               -- Project Build Management

## Setup
To run this project you must have JDK 11 or above, and install the JAR-file (of the latest release) locally.  
* For Windows:  Scrabble13_Win.jar  
* For MacOS:    Scrabble13_Mac.jar  
  
If double-clicking the .jar does not work even though you have a valid JDK installed, then do the following in the Command Prompt (Windows) / Terminal (MacOS)
```
$ cd .../Scrabble13               change directory to where you have installed the .jar
$ java -jar Scrabble13_XXX.jar    XXX depends on your OS and which jar you downloaded
```
